    <h2>Project Overview</h2>

    <li>
        Propel students enjoy playing video games. The Propel instructors would like to add a gaming experience to Propel.
    </li>
    <br>

    <li>
        One idea we have is to make use of augmented reality and develop a game that encourages students to engage with campus life
        and with their communities.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        For example, using the library, gym, eating in the cafeteria, going to Mind Body Connection or going to talks, plays, or sporting events, would all be examples of on-campus activities.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        Volunteering, taking the bus, working, applying for jobs, would be examples of off-campus activities.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        There would be some easy way students would register their participation. Maybe taking a picture, answering a question,
        or sharing their experiences.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        There could also be some way the students could use the game to prompt them for productive things to do on campus and
        to keep track of their own data. Students would play the game to earn badges.
    </li>
    <br>
    <li>
        The game would also be something that motivates students to do things that build autonomy, skills, sense of mastery.
    </li>
    <br>
    </ul>
